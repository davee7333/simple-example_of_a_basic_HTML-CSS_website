# simple-example_of_a_basic_HTML-CSS_website
Creating an entire website from scratch is a complex task that requires multiple files and assets. Below, I'll provide a simple example of a basic HTML/CSS website with a home page, but please note that this is just a starting point, and real websites are more comprehensive and tailored to specific needs.
# Place both the index.html and style.css files in the same directory.
# Open the index.html file in a web browser to see the basic website.
Remember, this is just a basic example of a static website. For dynamic and interactive websites, you'll need to use JavaScript or a web framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js. Additionally, real-world websites may require a backend server for handling data and user interactions.

To deploy a website, you'll need to host the files on a web server or use a hosting service that supports static websites. Services like GitHub Pages or Netlify are popular choices for hosting static sites. For more complex websites, you might need a dedicated web server or cloud hosting solution.
